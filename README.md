Independently developed a basic 3D flight simulator in Unity, focusing on realistic aircraft physics, terrain
rendering, and user-controlled flight mechanics. Implemented input handling for pitch, roll, yaw, and
throttle, along with aerodynamic modeling for lift and drag. Built custom environments and camera
systems to simulate first-person and third-person flight perspectives.
